-- performance notes:
    -- Both the pattern-matching and guard formulations
    -- using tail-call optimization are the most performant
    -- of my solutions
    --
    -- They are suprisingly more performant than !! indexing
    -- with the length function. I think this is because
    -- the length function is a killa, performance-wise

-- performance notes:
    -- Again, the pattern-matching solutions with TCO

    -- Also, 'last . init' is performant
    --
    -- The solution that uses guards sucks but that's

-- above equivalent to

-- THE REAL HASKELL is to use the !! indexing operator

-- Performance notes:
    -- TCO pattern-matching is most performant
    -- but also as performant as '!!' indexing,
    -- in this case

    -- head . drop is better that last . take

-- .01s - .03s - .05sj

-- CAUSES STACK OVERFLOW
length' =  foldr (\_ acc -> acc + 1) 0

-- strict version
-- .01s - .03s - .04s
length' = foldl' (\acc _ -> 1 + acc) 0

-- the real solution is to use the length function
--
-- performance notes:
    -- Any explicitly recursive function that cannot be
    -- TCO-ed causes a stack overflow
    --
    -- The explicit one that uses TCO is very performant,
    -- however
    --
    -- Similarly, the tail-recursive foldl works but the
    -- non-tail-recursive foldr does not work
